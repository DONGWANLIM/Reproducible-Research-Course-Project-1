## Loading and preprocessing the data

#Library setting
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)

#Unzip and read the file
path = getwd()
unzip("activity.zip", exdir = path)

initialData <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses=c("numeric", "Date", "numeric"))

head(initialData)
str(initialData)


##Question 1 - What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?

data <- initialData[!(is.na(initialData$steps)), ]

#Calculate total number of steps taken per day
totalStepsDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
head(totalStepsDay)

#If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
paletteBlue <- colorRampPalette(c("skyblue", "darkblue", "skyblue"))
hist(totalStepsDay$steps, breaks=20, xlab="Number of Steps Taken", 
     main="Histogram of the Total Number of Steps Taken per Day",
     col=paletteBlue(22), family="serif")

#The mean, median of the total number of steps taken per day is:
library(dplyr)
totalStepsSummary <- summarise(totalStepsDay, meanOfTotalSteps=mean(totalStepsDay$steps),
                               medianOfTotalSteps=median(totalStepsDay$steps))
print(totalStepsSummary)


##Question 2 - What is the average daily activity pattern?

#Make a time series plot (i.e. type = “𝚕”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
meanStepsInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)
head(meanStepsInterval)

plot(x=meanStepsInterval$interval, y=meanStepsInterval$steps, type="l",
     main="Time Series Plot of Average Steps Taken per Interval",
     ylab="Number of Steps", xlab="Intervals (in 5 mins)",
     col="darkblue", lwd=1.5, family="serif")

#Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
meanStepsInterval[grep(max(meanStepsInterval$steps), meanStepsInterval$steps), ]


##Question 3 - Imputing Missing Values

#As the data can be confirmed to contain some NA values as some of the observations:
anyNA(initialData)

#It is necessary to find out whether the NA values are more-so clustered to one area within the data. Looking at each of the variables:
data.frame(steps=sum(is.na(initialData$steps)), 
           interval=sum(is.na(initialData$interval)), 
           date=sum(is.na(initialData$date)))
           
#I used a for loop to achieve this, first testing if each observation was an NA value, and if so, replacing it with the mean average for that interval, (as calculated in a previous question).
imputedData <- initialData
for(x in 1:17568) {
    if(is.na(imputedData[x, 1])==TRUE) {
        imputedData[x, 1] <- meanStepsInterval[meanStepsInterval$interval %in% imputedData[x, 3], 2]
    }
}
head(imputedData)

#Now that the NA values have been replaced, a histogram from the imputed data can be created. This histogram should indicate the frequency of the total number of steps taken per day. Therefore again, the data must be grouped and "summed" by day.
imputedTotalStepsDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, imputedData, sum)
head(imputedTotalStepsDay)

#Creating the histogram:
paletteRed <- colorRampPalette(c("deeppink", "darkred", "deeppink"))
hist(imputedTotalStepsDay$steps, breaks=20, xlab="Number of Steps Taken", 
     main="Histogram of Total Number of Steps Taken per Day (With Imputed Values)",
     col=paletteRed(22), family="serif")
     
#The question then asks for calculation of the mean and median total number of steps taken per day, which can be calculated using the summarise function.
imputedStepsSummary <- summarise(imputedTotalStepsDay, 
                                 meanOfTotalSteps=mean(imputedTotalStepsDay$steps), 
                                 medianOfTotalSteps=median(imputedTotalStepsDay$steps))  
print(imputedStepsSummary)

#This a similar calculation to the one completed at the start of the assignment, (without the imputed values,) and thus they can be compared.
rbind(totalStepsSummary, imputedStepsSummary)

#If histograms of the two data sets (imputed and non-imputed) are compared:
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(totalStepsDay$steps, breaks=20, xlab="Number of Steps Taken", 
     col=paletteBlue(22), family="serif", ylim=c(0, 20), main=NULL)
hist(imputedTotalStepsDay$steps, breaks=20, xlab="Number of Steps Taken", 
     col=paletteRed(22), family="serif", ylim=c(0, 20), main=NULL)
mtext("Histograms of Total Number of Steps Taken per Day, Without/With Imputed Values",
      adj=0.95, family="serif", font=2)
      
#More explanations for the differences between the non and imputed data sets can be seen by looking at the NA values grouped by their date variable.
naByDate <- initialData[is.na(initialData$steps), ]
table(naByDate$date)

#As there are exactly 288 intervals measured for each day:
length(unique(data$interval))


##Question 4 - Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

#To achieve this, I used the weekdays function to automatically calculate the day of the week each day resided upon, (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) Next, I wrote a for loop, which would assign the factor value "weekend" to all rows it read as having the values "Saturday" or "Sunday", and assign "weekday" to the others.
daysData <- imputedData
daysData$days <- weekdays(daysData$date)
daysData$weekday <- as.character(rep(0, times=17568))
for(x in 1:17568) {
    if(daysData[x, 4] %in% c("토요일", "일요일")) {
        daysData[x, 5] <- "weekend"
    } else {
        daysData[x, 5] <- "weekday"
    }
}
daysData$weekday <- factor(daysData$weekday)
head(daysData)

#To compare the weekday and weekend data, and create two plots of the average number of steps taken per interval, the data has to be split into two groups of weekday/weekend data, using the newly created variable.
weekdayData <- daysData[daysData$weekday=="weekday", ]
weekendData <- daysData[daysData$weekday=="weekend", ]

#Next, the average number of steps per interval is calculated, much like it has been done in previous questions.
weekdayMean <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, weekdayData, mean)
weekendMean <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, weekendData, mean)

#Finally the panel plot is created. The x axis indicates each 5 minute interval, and the y axis shows the average number of steps taken. The two plots are divided into weekday, and weekend data.
par(mfrow=c(2, 1), mar=c(4, 4.1, 3, 2.1))
plot(weekdayMean$interval, weekdayMean$steps, type="l",
     main="Time Series Plot of Average Steps Taken per Interval, for Weekdays",
     xlab="Intervals (in 5 mins)", ylab="Number of Steps", family="serif",
     col="darkred", lwd=1.5, ylim=c(0, 230))
plot(weekendMean$interval, weekendMean$steps, type="l",
     main="Time Series Plot of Average Steps Taken per Interval, for Weekends",
     xlab="Intervals (in 5 mins)", ylab="Number of Steps", family="serif",
     col="darkblue", lwd=1.5, ylim=c(0, 230))
